## 🌦️ Weather-Information-System 

## 📚 Project Overview

🎯 Purpose:

The project aims to build a simple and efficient weather information system where users can search for real-time weather updates of any city.

❓Problem Statement:

People often need quick access to reliable weather forecasts. Many existing systems are either too complex or not tailored to educational use. This system solves that by providing a user-friendly console-based app.

💡 Why OOP?

Using OOP helps to structure the project into reusable, manageable, and scalable components — which is ideal for future upgrades and easier debugging.


## 🎯Project Goals & Key Functionalities

🥅 Main Goals:

Build a clean, console-based weather app.
Apply core OOP principles.
Learn API integration using Java.

🔑 Key Functionalities:

🌍 Search for weather by city.

🌡️ Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition.

🌡️ Convert temperature units.

⚠️ Handle errors (invalid city, network issue).

(Optional) ⭐ Save favorite cities.


## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies:

  ~ Programming Language: Java

 ~ Libraries: Java Standard Library

 ~ Database: Not used in current version (can be added for saving cities)


## 🧑‍💻 OOP Concepts Used:

🔒 Encapsulation:

All weather data is stored in private variables in the WeatherData class, with controlled access.

🧬 Inheritance:

Can be applied in future versions for expanding to forecast/weather alert subclasses.

🔄 Polymorphism:

(Can be added) Overloaded methods for displaying full vs. brief weather reports.

🕵️‍♂️ Abstraction:

The getWeather() method hides the internal API and parsing details from the user.


## 🗓️ Project Timeline & Phases:

         #Phase	                     #Tasks	                     #Duration(weeks)	         #Remarks
   Research & Planning       API selection, UML design	            2 weeks	              WeatherAPI
    Core Development	      Java classes, API integration	          3 weeks	         OOP principles applied
        Testing	          Unit tests, edge-case validation	        1 week          	90% accuracy achieved
     Documentation	         Report, Excel figures, PPT 	          1 week       	LaTeX used for professional docs
	




## 🎯 Expected Outcome:

✅ What will it achieve:

A Java console app that fetches live weather info by city input, displaying it neatly to the user.

🌍 Usefulness:

Help users get real-time data. It's also an educational project demonstrating practical use of Java OOP + APIs.

## 📜 Summary / Impact:

This project combines OOP concepts with real-world data. It encourages clean coding practice, real-time API use, and builds problem-solving skills. It’s a great steppingstone for bigger Java applications like mobile or GUI-based systems.
